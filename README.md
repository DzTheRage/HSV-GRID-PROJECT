# HSV GRID PROJECT
## About
The Huntsville Grid Project is a documentary photography site for students at the University of Alabama in Huntsville’s Art Department photography program. Inspired by the Portland Grid Project, the project focuses on documentary photography, where no editorial adjustments are made to a photograph once the shot is taken.
The area of the project is divided by five columns and five rows, to create 25 grid areas. Students participating in the Documentary Photography course are assigned two grids each within which to photograph. The HGP is bounded to the North by Pratt Avenue, the South by Governor’s Drive, to the West by Memorial Parkway, and to the East by California Street. The project started in 2012, and is an ongoing documentary effort.

All photographs are copyright by the respective artists and may not be used without the express permission of the photographer or the UAH Department of Art, Art History and Design.
